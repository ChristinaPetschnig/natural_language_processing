# Natural Language Processing

Research Question: How effective is natural language processing (NLP) in classifying social media content promoting eating disorders?

## Data Collection:

Gather a dataset of social media posts from platforms known to contain content related to eating disorders (e.g., Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest, TikTok). The content is primarily collected manually due to web-scraping limitations. 
More (artificial) text posts will be generated through prompt engineering with OpenAI and other available APIs.

## Annotation:

Annotate the collected dataset with labels indicating whether each post promotes eating disorders or not.
Use a reliable annotation process (All members are involved in the annotation process and discuss labels)

## Feature Extraction:

Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data (word frequencies, n-grams, and semantic embeddings)
Consider domain-specific features related to eating disorder content, such as specific keywords, phrases, or slang-related terms developed under the condition of such content being blocked by Admins.

## Model Development:

Experiment with different NLP models suitable for text classification tasks (Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or transformer-based architectures like BERT)

## Extras:

### Ethical Considerations:

Ensure that the project complies with ethical guidelines regarding the sensitive nature of the content.
Implement measures to protect the privacy and mental well-being of individuals represented in the data.

- Keep in Mind that this is a Project in scope of one Semester. The scope is applied on certain methodologies and work done in this project, in a bigger project more concise work would have been done in aspects of data collection and annotation for example.
