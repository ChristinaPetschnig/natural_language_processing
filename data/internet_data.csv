"• Reasons to not b1nge :

 🌸 eating only ever makes you feel worse

 🌸 bloatings gonna hit like a b1tch tomorrow 

 🌸 the cravings WILL go away

 🌸 you dont deserve it, you need to study more

 🌸 youre going to regret it one bite in

 🌸 you've been so good dont let this set you back

 🌸 one binge could lead to a series of binges

 🌸 wait for a meta day

 🌸 YOU decide what goes in ur body

 🌸 the numbers on the scale aren't an accident 

 🌸 an empty stomach feels better than regret

 🌸 you're serious about this right? act serious

 🌸 dont lose control.

"Body in Fasting Mode ੭* ੈ✩‧₊˚

There is literally nothing better than the feeling of fasting for soooo long that you body goes into ⭐ving mode and completely stops producing ghrelin(hormone that causes hunger). 

It feels like you stepped out of a sauna.

It feels like a cold glass of water. 

It feel like your finally in full control.

No stupid body signals, No hunger Panes, Only your own self-control to steer you to your goals.

Try it and you'll be addicted.

Gonna fast for 5 days to feel it again <3";1;Blog Post;Tumblr ;0;Manual ;;;;;;;;
